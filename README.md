# hypsithocus-no-choice

This R notebook contains code used to analyse data from experiments with Hypsithocus hudsonae, an endemic New Zealand pentatomid species, and Trissolcus japonicus, a scelionid parasitoid proposed for release as a biological control agent against brown marmorated stink bug in New Zealand (should the stink bug establish). The underlying dataset is derived from experiments conducted by Saunders et al with H. hudsonae and T. japonicus, combined with data from experiments by Charles et al (2019) (https://dx.doi.org/10/ggrtkp). We (Saunders et al) conducted no-choice oviposition experiments under very similar conditions to Charles et al, so that we could eventually pool the data to look at differences in parasitoid emergence between different non-target New Zealand pentatomid species.
